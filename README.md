# Save The Amazon Game
This is the second game I created for my game design class. The basis is that the Amazon warehouse has been over run by its droids, and you need to find a screw driver and go fix the beacon that controls them. It explores Unity 3D including, player movement, player tracking. enemy movement, state of game tracking and player health. I created the 3d model robots in Blender and messed up the animation but kept it because I thought it was funny. 

You can run the game by downloading the files and opening game.exe. You can also open the files individually or all together in unity to look at how everything was put together.
