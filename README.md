# Save The Amazon Game
This is the second game I created for my game design class. The basis is that the Amazon warehouse has been over run by its droids, and you need to find a screw driver and go fix the beacon that controls them. It explores Unity 3D including, player movement, player tracking. enemy movement, state of game tracking and player health. I created the 3d model robots in Blender and messed up the animation but kept it because I thought it was funny.
